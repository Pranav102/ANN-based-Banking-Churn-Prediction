# ANN-based-Banking-Churn-Prediction
- This repository will have complete machine learning and deep learning based banking churn prediction ANN model which will analyze tha probablity for a customer to leave.
- The project was deployed on Google Cloud Platform as well as completely tested on Localhost.

## Project Description
### Welcome Screen
- The main welcome screen is made in HTML5 and CSS3 with a basic and simple design.
- Here is the main screen for the Bank Churn Prediction Interface for the bank admin.

## Analysis and Accuracy
- The Prediction engine is built over a deep **Artificial Neural Network** backed with **[Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras)**.
- I have achieved an accuracy of around **~85%** on both training and testing data.
